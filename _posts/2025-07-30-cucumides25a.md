abstract: The challenge of answering graph queries over incomplete knowledge graphs
  is gaining significant attention in the machine learning community. Neuro-symbolic
  models have emerged as a promising approach, combining good performance with high
  interpretability. These models utilize trained architectures to execute atomic queries
  and integrate modules that mimic symbolic query operators. Most neuro-symbolic query
  processors, however, are either constrained to \ast tree-like\ast  graph pattern
  queries or incur an extensive computational overhead. We introduce a framework for
  \ast efficiently\ast  answering \ast arbitrary\ast  graph pattern queries over incomplete
  knowledge graphs, encompassing both tree-like and cyclic queries. Our approach employs
  an approximation scheme that facilitates acyclic traversals for cyclic patterns,
  thereby embedding additional symbolic bias into the query execution process. Supporting
  general graph pattern queries is crucial for practical applications but remains
  a limitation for most current neuro-symbolic models. Our framework addresses this
  gap. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our framework performs competitively
  on three datasets, effectively handling cyclic queries through our approximation
  strategy. Additionally, it maintains the performance of existing neuro-symbolic
  models on anchored tree-like queries and extends their capabilities to queries with
  existentially quantified variables.
