abstract: 'Reducing a graph while preserving its overall properties is an important
  problem with many applications. Typically, reduction approaches either remove edges
  (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific
  downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph
  structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning
  the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our
  approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream
  task in an end-to-end fashion without requiring a differentiable loss function for
  the task. We showcase the versatility of our approach on four distinct applications:
  image segmentation, explainability for graph classification, 3D shape sparsification,
  and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.'
