abstract: 'Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent a contemporary
  class of generative models with exceptional qualities in both synthesis and maximizing
  the data likelihood. These models work by traversing a forward Markov Chain where
  data is perturbed, followed by a reverse process where a neural network learns to
  undo the perturbations and recover the original data. There have been increasing
  efforts exploring the applications of DDPMs in the graph domain. However, most of
  them have focused on the generative perspective. In this paper, we aim to build
  a novel generative model for link prediction. In particular, we treat link prediction
  between a pair of nodes as a conditional likelihood estimation of its enclosing
  sub-graph. With a dedicated design to decompose the likelihood estimation process
  via the Bayesian formula, we are able to separate the estimation of sub-graph structure
  and its node features. Such designs allow our model to simultaneously enjoy the
  advantages of  inductive learning and the strong generalization capability. Remarkably,
  comprehensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed method
  presents numerous advantages: (1) transferability across datasets without retraining,
  (2) promising generalization on limited training data, and (3) robustness against
  graph adversarial attacks.'
