abstract: Discovering and tracking communities in time-varying networks is an important
  task in network science, motivated by applications in fields ranging from neuroscience
  to sociology. In this work, we characterize the celebrated family of spectral methods
  for static clustering in terms of the low-rank approximation of high-dimensional
  node embeddings. From this perspective, it becomes natural to view the evolving
  community detection problem as one of subspace tracking on the Grassmann manifold.
  While the resulting optimization problem is nonconvex, we adopt a recently proposed
  block majorize-minimize Riemannian optimization scheme to learn the Grassmann geodesic
  which best fits the data. Our framework generalizes any static spectral community
  detection approach and leads to algorithms achieving favorable performance on synthetic
  and real temporal networks, including those that are weighted, signed, directed,
  mixed-membership, multiview, hierarchical, cocommunity-structured, bipartite, or
  some combination thereof. We demonstrate how to specifically cast a wide variety
  of methods into our framework, and demonstrate greatly improved dynamic community
  detection results in all cases.
