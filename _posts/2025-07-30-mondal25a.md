abstract: 'Experience Replay (ER) methods in graph continual learning (GCL) mitigate
  catastrophic forgetting by storing and replaying historical tasks.  However, these
  methods often struggle with efficiently storing tasks in a compact memory buffer,
  affecting scalability. While recently proposed graph condensation techniques address
  this by summarizing historical graphs, they often inadequately capture variations
  within the distribution of historical tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
  called \ast Stochastic Experience Replay for GCL (SERGCL)\ast , by incorporating
  a \ast stochastic memory buffer (SMB)\ast  that parameterizes a kernel function
  to estimate the distribution density of condensed graphs for each historical task.
  This allows efficient sampling of condensed graphs, leading to better coverage of
  historical tasks in the memory buffer and improved experience replay. Our experimental
  results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed SERGCL framework
  achieves up to an 8.5% improvement of the \ast average performance\ast  compared
  to the current state-of-the-art GCL models. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/jayjaynandy/sergcl}{https://github.com/jayjaynandy/sergcl}'
