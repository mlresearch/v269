abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success
  in node classification on homophilic graphs. It has been shown that they do not
  solely rely on homophily but on neighborhood distributions of nodes, i.e., consistency
  of the neighborhood label distribution within the same class. MLP-based models do
  not use message passing, i.e.,Graph-MLP incorporates the neighborhood in a separate
  loss function. These models are faster and robust to edge noise. Graph-MLP maps
  adjacent nodes closer in the embedding space but is unaware of the neighborhood
  pattern of the labels, i.e., relies solely on homophily. Edge-Splitting GNN (ES-GNN)
  is a model specialized for heterophilic graphs and splits the edges into task-relevant
  and task-irrelevant, respectively. To mitigate the limitations of Graph-MLP on heterophilic
  graphs, we propose ES-MLP that combines Graph-MLP with an edge-splitting mechanism
  from ES-GNN. It incorporates the edge splitting into the loss of Graph-MLP to learn
  two separate adjacency matrices based on relevant and irrelevant feature pairs.
  Our experiments on seven datasets with five baselines show that ES-MLP is on par
  with homophilic and heterophilic models on all datasets without using edges during
  inference. We show that ES-MLP is robust to multiple types of edge noise during
  inference and its inference time is two to five times faster than commonly used
  MPNNs. We will make our source code available.
