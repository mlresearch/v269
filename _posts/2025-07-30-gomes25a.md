abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are commonly applied to graph data, but their
  performance is often poorly understood. It is easy to find examples in which a GNN
  is unable to learn useful graph representations, but generally hard to explain why.
  In this work, we analyse the effectiveness of graph representations learned by GNNs
  for input graphs with different structural properties and feature information. We
  expand on the failure cases by decoupling the impact of structural and feature information
  on the learning process. Our results indicate that GNNsâ€™ implicit architectural
  assumptions are tightly related to the structural properties of the input graph
  and may impair its learning ability. In case of mismatch, they can often be outperformed
  by structure-agnostic methods like multi-layer perceptrons.
