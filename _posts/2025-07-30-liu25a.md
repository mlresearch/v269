abstract: Attention Graph Neural Networks (AT-GNNs), such as GAT and Graph Transformer,
  have demonstrated superior performance compared to other GNNs. However, existing
  GNN systems struggle to efficiently train AT-GNNs on GPUs due to their intricate
  computation patterns. The execution of AT-GNN operations without kernel fusion results
  in heavy data movement and significant kernel launch overhead, while fixed thread
  scheduling in existing GNN kernel fusion strategies leads to sub-optimal performance,
  redundant computation and unbalanced workload. To address these challenges, we propose
  a dynamic kernel fusion framework, DF-GNN, for the AT-GNN family. DF-GNN introduces
  a dynamic bi-level thread scheduling strategy, enabling flexible adjustments to
  thread scheduling while retaining the benefits of shared memory within the fused
  kernel. DF-GNN tailors specific thread scheduling for operations in AT-GNNs and
  considers the performance bottleneck shift caused by the presence of super nodes.
  Additionally, DF-GNN is integrated with the PyTorch framework for high programmability.
  Evaluations across diverse GNN models and multiple datasets reveal that DF-GNN surpasses
  existing GNN kernel optimization works like cuGraph and dgNN, with speedups up to
  \textdollar 7.0\times\textdollar  over the state-of-the-art non-fusion DGL sparse
  library. Moreover, it achieves an average speedup of \textdollar 2.16\times\textdollar  in
  end-to-end training compared to the popular GNN computing framework DGL.
