abstract: The past sexennium has witnessed rapid advancements of hyperbolic neural
  networks. However, it is challenging to learn good hyperbolic representations since
  common Euclidean neural operations, such as convolution, do not extend to the hyperbolic
  space. Most hyperbolic neural networks omit the convolution operation and cannot
  effectively extract local patterns. Others either only use non-hyperbolic convolution,
  or miss essential properties such as equivariance to permutation. We propose HKConv,
  a novel trainable hyperbolic convolution which first correlates trainable local
  hyperbolic features with fixed kernel points placed in the hyperbolic space, then
  aggregates the output features within a local neighborhood. HKConv is a generic
  framework where any coordinate model of the hyperbolic space can be flexibly used.
  We show that neural networks with HKConv layers advance state-of-the-art in various
  tasks. The code of our implementation is available at https://github.com/BruceZhangReve/Hyperbolic-Kernel-Convolution
