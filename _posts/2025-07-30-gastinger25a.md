abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to understanding global crises and
  trade patterns through the creation and analysis of a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG),
  and the application of Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting. Combining data from
  the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Global Trade Alerts
  (GTA), the TKG offers a comprehensive view of the intersection between worldwide
  crises and global trade over time. We detail the process of TKG creation, including
  the aggregation and merging of information from multiple sources. Furthermore, we
  conduct a detailed analysis of the TKG, providing insights into its potential applicability
  to data-driven Resilience Research. Leveraging the constructed TKG, we predict global
  trade events, such as trade sanctions across various categories and countries, and
  conflict events, such as worldwide military actions, to identify potential trade
  disruptions and anticipate the economic impact of global conflicts. To achieve this,
  state-of-the-art models for TKG Forecasting are applied and rigorously evaluated,
  contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex relationship between global
  crises and trade dynamics.
