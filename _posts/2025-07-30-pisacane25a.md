abstract: Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently
  approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior
  methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which
  is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area
  of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications.  Inspired
  by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient
  search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task
  between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose
  a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily
  and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world
  social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and
  heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for
  graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning.
