abstract: Application of artificial intelligence (AI) has been ubiquitous in the growth
  of research in the areas of basic sciences. Frequent use of machine learning (ML)
  and deep learning (DL) based methodologies by researchers has resulted in significant
  advancements in the last decade. These techniques led to notable performance enhancements
  in different tasks such as protein structure prediction, drug-target binding affinity
  prediction, and molecular property prediction. In material science literature, it
  is well-known that crystalline materials exhibit topological structures. Such topological
  structures may be represented as graphs and utilization of graph neural network
  (GNN) based approaches could help encoding them into an augmented representation
  space. Primarily, such frameworks adopt supervised learning techniques targeted
  towards downstream property prediction tasks on the basis of electronic properties
  (formation energy, bandgap, total energy, etc.) and crystalline structures. Generally,
  such type of frameworks rely highly on the handcrafted atom feature representations
  along with the structural representations. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
  framework namely, CrysAtom, using untagged crystal data to generate dense vector
  representation of atoms, which can be utilized in existing GNN-based property predictor
  models to accurately predict important properties of crystals. Empirical results
  show that our dense representation embeds chemical properties of atoms and enhance
  the performance of the baseline property predictor models significantly.
