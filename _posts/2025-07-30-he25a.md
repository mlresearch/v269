abstract: Network alignment is the task of establishing one-to-one correspondences
  between the nodes of different graphs. Although finding a plethora of applications
  in high-impact domains, this task is known to be NP-hard in its general form. Existing
  optimization algorithms do not scale up as the size of the graphs increases. While
  being able to reduce the matching complexity, current GNN approaches fit a deep
  neural network on each graph and requires re-train on unseen samples, which is time
  and memory inefficient. To tackle both challenges we propose T-GAE, a transferable
  graph autoencoder framework that leverages transferability and stability of GNNs
  to achieve efficient network alignment on out-of-distribution graphs without retraining.
  We prove that GNN-generated embeddings can achieve more accurate alignment compared
  to classical spectral methods. Our experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate
  that T-GAE outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization method and the best GNN
  approach by up to 38.7% and 50.8%, respectively, while being able to reduce 90\%
  of the training time when matching out-of-distribution large scale networks. We
  conduct ablation studies to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed encoder
  architecture and training objective in enhancing the expressiveness of GNNs to match
  perturbed graphs. T-GAE is also proved to be flexible to utilize matching algorithms
  of different complexities. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jason-Tree/T-GAE.
