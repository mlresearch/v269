abstract: 'A fundamental challenge confronting supervised graph outlier detection
  algorithms is the prevalent problem of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier
  instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance.
  Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their
  efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation
  quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection
  remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data
  augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection
  via latent Diffusion Models. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets
  substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated
  the generation quality of our synthetic data. To foster accessibility and reproducibility,
  we encapsulate GODM into a plug-and-play package and release it at PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/godm/.'
