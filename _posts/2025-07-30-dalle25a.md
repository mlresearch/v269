abstract: For Graph Neural Networks, oversmoothing denotes the homogenization of vertex
  embeddings as the number of layers increases. To better understand this phenomenon,
  we study community detection with a linearized Graph Convolutional Network on the
  Contextual Stochastic Block Model. We express the distribution of the embeddings
  in each community as a Gaussian mixture over a low-dimensional latent space, with
  explicit formulas in the case of a single layer. This yields tractable estimators
  for classification accuracy at finite depth. Numerical experiments suggest that
  modeling with a single Gaussian is insufficient and that the impact of depth may
  be more complex than previously anticipated.
