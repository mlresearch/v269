abstract: The ability of message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to fit complex functions
  over graphs is limited as most graph convolutions amplify the same signal across
  all feature channels, a phenomenon known as rank collapse, and over-smoothing as
  a special case. Most approaches to mitigate over-smoothing extend common message-passing
  schemes, e.g., the graph convolutional network, by utilizing residual connections,
  gating mechanisms, normalization, or regularization techniques. Our work contrarily
  proposes to directly tackle the cause of this issue by modifying the message-passing
  scheme and exchanging different types of messages using multi-relational graphs.
  We identify a sufficient condition to ensure linearly independent node representations.
  As one instantion, we show that operating on multiple directed acyclic graphs always
  satisfies our condition and propose to obtain these by defining a strict partial
  ordering of the nodes. We conduct comprehensive experiments that confirm the benefits
  of operating on multi-relational graphs to achieve more informative node representations.
