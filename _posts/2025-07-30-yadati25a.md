abstract: 'Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a type of Graph Neural Networks
  (GNNs) that utilise the graph structure to facilitate the exchange of messages along
  the edges.  On the one hand, the inductive bias gives rise to a phenomenon termed
  "over-squashing," where a nodeâ€™s hidden feature becomes insensitive to information
  present in distant nodes.  On the other hand, there has been a recent wave of innovations
  involving the adaptation of MPNNs and GNNs to hypergraphs, which relax the notion
  of an edge to a hyperedge containing a subset of nodes.  In recent times, MPNNs
  and GNNs have found application in web datasets, spanning both graph and hypergraph
  scenarios.  However, there exists a research gap regarding the investigation of
  over-squashing within hypergraph neural networks.  Our paper contributes to bridging
  this precise research gap by investigating several methods each belonging to one
  of two distinct classes of hypergraph neural networks.  To begin with, we introduce
  three novel problems termed HyperEdgeSingle, HyperEdgePath, and HyperEdgeRing designed
  specifically for assessing the phenomenon of over-squashing within hypergraph neural
  networks.  Through theoretical and experimental analyses, we reveal a counter-intuitive
  and significant finding: advanced state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks are
  more susceptible to over-squashing than their predecessors.  Validation of the findings
  is reinforced through experiments conducted on real-world datasets.'
