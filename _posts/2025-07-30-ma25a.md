abstract: This paper considers the problem of completing a rating matrix based on
  sub-sampled matrix entries as well as observed social graphs and hypergraphs. We
  show that there exists a \ast sharp threshold\ast  on the sample probability for
  the task of exactly completing the rating matrix—the task is achievable when the
  sample probability is above the threshold, and is impossible otherwise—demonstrating
  a phase transition phenomenon. The threshold can be expressed as a function of the
  \textasciigrave \textasciigrave quality”of hypergraphs, enabling us to  \ast quantify\ast  the
  amount of reduction in sample probability due to the exploitation of hypergraphs.
  This also highlights the usefulness of hypergraphs in the matrix completion problem.
  En route to discovering the sharp threshold, we develop a computationally efficient
  matrix completion algorithm that effectively exploits the observed graphs and hypergraphs.
  Theoretical analyses show that our algorithm succeeds with high probability as long
  as the sample probability exceeds the aforementioned threshold, and this theoretical
  result is further validated by synthetic experiments.  Moreover, our experiments
  on a real social network dataset (with both graphs and hypergraphs) show that our
  algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art matrix completion algorithms.
