abstract: In spite of the plethora of success stories with graph neural networks (GNNs)
  on modelling graph-structured data, they are notoriously vulnerable to over-squashing,
  whereby tasks necessitate the mixing of information between distance pairs of nodes.
  To address this problem, prior work suggests rewiring the graph structure to improve
  information flow. Alternatively, a significant body of research has dedicated itself
  to discovering and pre-computing bottleneck-free graph structures to ameliorate
  over-squashing. One such family of bottleneck-free graphs well regarded in the mathematical
  community are \emph{expander graphs}, with prior work—Expander Graph Propagation
  (EGP)—proposing the use of a well-known expander graph family—the Cayley graphs
  of the \textdollar \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_n)\textdollar  special linear group—as
  a computational template for GNNs. However, despite its solid theoretical grounding,
  the computational graphs used by EGP are truncated to align with a given input graph.
  In this work, we show that such an approach is detrimental to the coveted expansion
  properties, and instead propose a method that propagates information over the complete
  Cayley graph structure, thereby ensuring it is bottleneck-free to better alleviate
  over-squashing. Our empirical evidence across several real-world datasets not only
  shows our method recovers significant improvements as compared to EGP, but also
  akin to or outperforming computationally complex graph rewiring techniques.
