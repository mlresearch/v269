abstract: Current memory-based methods for dynamic graph learning use batch processing
  to efficiently handle high stream of updates. However, the use of batches introduces
  a phenomenon we term \textdollar \textit{missing updates}\textdollar , which adversely
  affects the performance of memory-based models. In this work, we analyze the negative
  impacts of \textdollar \textit{missing updates}\textdollar  on dynamic graph learning
  models, and propose the decoupling strategy to mitigate these effects. Based on
  this strategy, we develop the Lightweight Decoupled Temporal Graph Network (LDTGN),
  a memory-based model with a minimal number of learnable parameters that deals with
  high frequency of updates. We validated our proposed model across diverse dynamic
  graph benchmarks. LDTGN surpassed the average precision of previous methods by over
  20\% in scenarios demanding frequent graph updates. In the vast majority of the
  benchmarks, LDTGN achieves better or comparable results while operating with significantly
  higher throughput than existing baselines. The code to replicate our experiments
  is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Modules-Decoupling-TGN-6FE7.
