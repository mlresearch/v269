abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aligns node representations by classifying
  node pairs into positives and negatives using a selection process that typically
  relies on establishing correspondences within two augmented graphs. The conventional
  GCL approaches incorporate negative samples uniformly in the contrastive loss, resulting
  in the equal treatment of negative nodes, regardless of their proximity to the true
  positive. In this paper, we present a Smoothed Graph Contrastive Learning model
  (SGCL), which leverages the geometric structure of augmented graphs to inject proximity
  information associated with positive/negative pairs in the contrastive loss, thus
  significantly regularizing the learning process. The proposed SGCL adjusts the penalties
  associated with node pairs in contrastive loss by incorporating three distinct smoothing
  techniques that result in proximity-aware positives and negatives. To enhance scalability
  for large-scale graphs, the proposed framework incorporates a graph batch-generating
  strategy that partitions the given graphs into multiple subgraphs, facilitating
  efficient training in separate batches. Through extensive experimentation in the
  unsupervised setting on various benchmarks, particularly those of large scale, we
  demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against recent baselines.
