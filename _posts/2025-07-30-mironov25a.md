abstract: 'Homophily is a graph property describing the tendency of edges to connect
  similar nodes. There are several measures used for assessing homophily but all are
  known to have certain drawbacks: in particular, they cannot be reliably used for
  comparing datasets with varying numbers of classes and class size balance. To show
  this, previous works on graph homophily suggested several properties desirable for
  a good homophily measure, also noting that no existing homophily measure has all
  these properties. Our paper addresses this issue by introducing a new homophily
  measure —unbiased homophily —that has all the desirable properties and thus can
  be reliably used across datasets with different label distributions. The proposed
  measure is suitable for undirected (and possibly weighted) graphs. We show both
  theoretically and via empirical examples that the existing homophily measures have
  serious drawbacks while unbiased homophily has a desirable behavior for the considered
  scenarios. Finally, when it comes to directed graphs, we prove that some desirable
  properties contradict each other and thus a measure satisfying all of them cannot
  exist.'
