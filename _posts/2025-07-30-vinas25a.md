abstract: We revisit recent spectral GNN approaches to semi-supervised node classification
  (SSNC). We posit that state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures may be over-engineered
  for common SSNC benchmark datasets (citation networks, page-page networks, etc.).
  By replacing feature aggregation with a non-parametric learner we are able to streamline
  the GNN design process and avoid many of the engineering complexities associated
  with SOTA hyperparameter selection (GNN depth, non-linearity choice, feature dropout
  probability, etc.). Our empirical experiments suggest conventional methods such
  as non-parametric regression are well suited for semi-supervised learning on sparse,
  directed networks and a variety of other graph types commonly found in SSNC benchmarks.
  Additionally, we bring attention to recent changes in evaluation conventions for
  SSNC benchmarking and how this may have partially contributed to rising performances
  over time.
