abstract: 'Fully inductive knowledge graph models can be trained on multiple domains
  and subsequently perform zero-shot knowledge graph completion (KGC) in new unseen
  domains. This is an important capability towards the goal of having foundation models
  for knowledge graphs. In this work, we introduce a more expressive and capable fully
  inductive model, dubbed TRIX, which not only yields strictly more expressive triplet
  embeddings (head entity, relation, tail entity) compared to state-of-the-art methods,
  but also introduces a new capability: directly handling both entity and relation
  prediction tasks in inductive settings. Empirically, we show that TRIX outperforms
  the state-of-the-art fully inductive models in zero-shot entity and relation predictions
  in new domains, and outperforms large-context LLMs in out-of-domain predictions.
