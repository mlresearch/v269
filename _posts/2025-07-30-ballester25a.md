abstract: Persistent homology, a technique from computational topology, has recently
  shown strong empirical performance in the context of graph classification. Being
  able to capture long range graph properties via higher-order topological features,
  such as cycles of arbitrary length, in combination with multi-scale topological
  descriptors, has improved predictive performance for data sets with prominent topological
  structures, such as molecules. At the same time, the theoretical properties of persistent
  homology have not been formally assessed in this context. This paper intends to
  bridge the gap between computational topology and graph machine learning by providing
  a brief introduction to persistent homology in the context of graphs, as well as
  a theoretical discussion and empirical analysis of its expressivity for graph learning
  tasks.
