abstract: We consider if the techniques used in the design of approximation algorithms
  can be leveraged to develop effective learning solutions for NP-hard graph problems.  Specifically,
  we focus on semi-definite programs (SDPs), a powerful technique from operations
  research, that has been used in the design of many approximation algorithms. In
  these approximation algorithms, one typically solves an SDP relaxation of the optimization
  objective and then performs some problem-specific rounding of the SDP solution.
  In this paper, we present a learning framework that utilizes Hopfield networks to
  round the SDP solution for different problems. We show empirically that the approach
  performs well on benchmarking instances of three well-studied problems namely Max-Cut,
  Max-Clique and Graph Coloring. The solutions obtained are close to optimal and significantly
  better than those obtained by the corresponding approximation algorithms. The primary
  advantage of such a simple heuristic is that it can be applied to a large number
  of problems without much problem-specific engineering. Another advantage of our
  approach is that we only need a small number of tunable parameters in the rounding
  algorithm - this is because we start with an SDP solution which already contains
  useful global information. This in turn means that the parameters can be learnt
  efficiently with a small amount of training data. We also show that even approximate
  solutions to the SDP relaxation suffice - this makes our approach fast and practical.
