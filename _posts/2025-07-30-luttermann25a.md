abstract: Lifted probabilistic inference exploits symmetries in a probabilistic model
  to allow for tractable probabilistic inference with respect to domain sizes of logical
  variables. We found that the current state-of-the-art algorithm to construct a lifted
  representation in form of a parametric factor graph misses symmetries between factors
  that are exchangeable but scaled differently, thereby leading to a less compact
  representation. In this paper, we propose a generalisation of the advanced colour
  passing (ACP) algorithm, which is the state of the art to construct a parametric
  factor graph. Our proposed algorithm allows for potentials of factors to be scaled
  arbitrarily and efficiently detects more symmetries than the original ACP algorithm.
  By detecting strictly more symmetries than ACP, our algorithm significantly reduces
  online query times for probabilistic inference when the resulting model is applied,
  which we also confirm in our experiments.
