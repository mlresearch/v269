abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant paradigm for
  learning from graph-structured data, offering a wide range of applications from
  social network analysis to bioinformatics.  Despite their versatility, GNNs face
  challenges such as lack of generalization and poor interpretability, which hinder
  their wider adoption and reliability in critical applications.  Dropping has emerged
  as an effective paradigm for improving the generalization capabilities of GNNs.
  However, existing approaches often rely on random or heuristic-based selection criteria,
  lacking a principled method to identify and exclude nodes that contribute to noise
  and over-complexity in the model. In this work, we argue that explainability should
  be a key indicator of a model’s quality throughout its training phase.  To this
  end, we introduce xAI-Drop, a novel topological-level dropping regularizer that
  leverages explainability to pinpoint noisy network elements to be excluded from
  the GNN propagation mechanism.  An empirical evaluation on diverse real-world datasets
  demonstrates that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art dropping approaches
  in accuracy, and improves explanation quality.
