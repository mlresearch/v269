abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models have been increasingly
  adopted to learn the complex vector representations of spatio-temporal graphs, capturing
  intricate spatio-temporal dependencies crucial for applications such as traffic
  datasets. Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms
  and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal
  relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently,
  and reflect the graphâ€™s topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this
  work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based
  on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer
  perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal
  block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating
  spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological
  information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with
  mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable
  of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the
  message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy
  of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal
  benchmark datasets. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/cy2mixer-D5A9.'
