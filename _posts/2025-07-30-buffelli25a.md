abstract: Graph neural networks have become the default choice by practitioners for
  graph learning tasks such as graph classification and node classification. Nevertheless,
  popular graph neural network models still struggle to capture higher-order information,
  i.e., information that goes beyond pairwise interactions. Recent work has shown
  that persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, can enrich graph
  neural networks with topological information that they otherwise could not capture.
  Calculating such features is efficient for dimension 0 (connected components) and
  dimension 1 (cycles). However, when it comes to higher-order structures, it does
  not scale well, with a complexity of \textdollar O(n\^{}d)\textdollar , where \textdollar
  n\textdollar  is the number of nodes and \textdollar d\textdollar  is the order
  of the structures. In this work, we introduce a novel method that extracts information
  about higher-order structures in the graph while still using the efficient low-dimensional
  persistent homology algorithm. On standard benchmark datasets, we show that our
  method can lead to up to 31% improvements in test accuracy.
