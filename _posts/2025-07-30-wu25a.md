abstract: 'The power grid is a critical dynamical system that forms the backbone of
  modern society, powering everything from household appliances to complex industrial
  machinery. However, this essential system is not without vulnerabilities â€“ as electricity
  travels at lightspeed, unanticipated failures can cause catastrophic consequences
  such as country-wide blackouts in a cascading manner. In response to such threats,
  we introduce NP-NDS, a nature-powered nonlinear dynamical system designed to accurately
  and rapidly predict power grids as macroscopic dynamical systems in the real world.
  In particular, NP-NDS is established through a Hamiltonian-Hardware co-design: First,
  NP-NDS employs a hardware-friendly serial-additive Hamiltonian based on Chebyshev
  series for accurately capturing highly nonlinear interactions among power grid nodes,
  coupled with node-relation-aware training for high accuracy. Second, NP-NDS features
  a fully CMOS-based hardware dynamical system governed by the proposed Hamiltonian,
  facilitating inferences with "speed of electrons". Results show that NP-NDS achieves,
  on average, \textdollar 2.3\times 10\^{}3\textdollar  speedup and \textdollar 10\^{}5\times\textdollar  energy
  reduction with 23.6% and 28.2% decrease in MAE and RMSE compared to GNNs on power
  grid forecasting datasets.'
