abstract: 'Many real world graphs are inherently dynamic, constantly evolving with
  node and edge additions. These graphs can be represented by temporal graphs, either
  through a stream of edge events or a sequence of graph snapshots. Until now, the
  development of machine learning methods for both types has occurred largely in isolation,
  resulting in limited experimental comparison and theoretical cross- pollination
  between the two. In this paper, we introduce Unified Temporal Graph (UTG), a framework
  that unifies snapshot-based and event-based machine learning models under a single
  umbrella, enabling models developed for one representation to be applied effectively
  to datasets of the other. We also propose a novel UTG training procedure to boost
  the performance of snapshot-based models in the streaming setting. We comprehensively
  evaluate both snapshot and event-based models across both types of temporal graphs
  on the temporal link prediction task. Our main findings are threefold: first, when
  combined with UTG training, snapshot-based models can perform competitively with
  event- based models such as TGN and GraphMixer even on event datasets. Second, snapshot-based
  models are at least an order of magnitude faster than most event- based models during
  inference. Third, while event-based methods such as NAT and DyGFormer outperforms
  snapshot-based methods on both types of temporal graphs, this is because they leverage
  joint neighborhood structural features thus emphasizing the potential to incorporate
  these features into snapshot-based models as well. These findings highlight the
  importance of comparing model architectures independent of the data format and suggest
  the potential of combining the efficiency of snapshot-based models with the performance
  of event-based models in the future.'
