abstract: Recent research has incorporated knowledge graphs to mitigate the issue
  of data sparsity in recommendations. However, while leveraging the rich information
  from knowledge graphs exhibits promising performance enhancements, it also introduces
  noise that potentially disrupts collaborative signals. To overcome this problem,
  we propose the Knowledge Graph Preference Contrastive Learning for Recommendation,
  namely KPCL. The preference learning method and rationale attention mechanism are
  designed to explicitly track collaborative signals and identify informative knowledge
  connections from both macro and micro perspectives. Specifically, preference learning
  is used to alleviate semantic dissonance in knowledge embeddings by exploring intent
  correlations in user-item interaction history, while the rationale attention restructures
  the knowledge graph by eliminating knowledge triplets with low attention scores
  as noise. By aggregating the information in the knowledge graph through the selected
  knowledge triplets, the task-unrelated noise presented would be filtered out, leading
  to enhanced performance for the knowledge-aware recommender system. Experimental
  results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of KPCL over the
  state-of-the-art methods. The implementations for KPCL are available at https://github.com/HuiCir/KPCL.
