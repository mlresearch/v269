abstract: Temporal graph representation learning (TGRL) is essential for modeling
  dynamic systems in real-world networks. However, traditional TGRL methods, despite
  their effectiveness, often face significant computational challenges and inference
  delays due to the inefficient sampling of temporal neighbors. Conventional sampling
  methods typically involve backtracking through the interaction history of each node.
  In this paper, we propose a novel TGRL framework, No-Looking-Back (NLB), which overcomes
  these challenges by introducing a forward recent sampling strategy. This strategy
  eliminates the need to backtrack through historical interactions by utilizing a
  GPU-executable, size-constrained hash table for each node. The hash table records
  a down-sampled set of recent interactions, enabling rapid query responses with minimal
  inference latency. The maintenance of this hash table is highly efficient, operating
  with \textdollar O(1)\textdollar  complexity. Fully compatible with GPU processing,
  NLB maximizes programmability, parallelism, and power efficiency. Empirical evaluations
  demonstrate that NLB not only matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy
  for tasks like link prediction and node classification across six real-world datasets
  but also achieves 1.32-4.40\textdollar \times\textdollar  faster training, 1.2-7.94\textdollar
  \times\textdollar  greater energy efficiency, and 1.63-12.95\textdollar \times\textdollar  lower
  inference latency compared to competitive baselines.
