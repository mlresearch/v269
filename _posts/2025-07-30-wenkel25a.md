abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success for a variety of
  tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However,
  the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization
  (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce GCON, a novel GNN architecture
  that leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms to solve
  CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based
  CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum clique, minimum
  dominating set, and maximum cut problems in a self-supervised learning setting.
  GCON is competitive across all tasks and consistently outperforms other specialized
  GNN-based approaches, and is on par with the powerful Gurobi solver on the max-cut
  problem. We provide an open-source implementation of our work at https://github.com/WenkelF/copt.
