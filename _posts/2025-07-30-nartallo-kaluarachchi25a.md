abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations
  is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from
  real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics
  of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over
  a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories.
  Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow
  on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic
  process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose
  our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and
  reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our
  approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight
  into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats.
  In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between
  healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks
  new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and
  graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis
  of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future
  analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and
  continuous spaces.
