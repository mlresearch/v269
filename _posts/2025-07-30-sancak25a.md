abstract: Despite advances in graph learning, increasingly complex models introduce
  significant overheads, including prolonged preprocessing and training times, excessive
  memory requirements, and numerous hyperparameters which often limit their scalability
  to large datasets. Consequently, evaluating model effectiveness in this rapidly
  growing field has become increasingly challenging. We investigate whether complicated
  methods are necessary if foundational and scalable models can achieve better quality
  on large datasets. We first demonstrate that Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is
  able to achieve competitive quality using skip connections on large datasets. Next,  we
  argue that existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) skip connections are incomplete,
  lacking neighborhood embeddings within them. To address this, we introduce Neighbor
  Aware Skip Connections (NASC), a novel skip connection with an adaptive weighting
  strategy. Our evaluation show that GCN with NASC outperforms various baselines on
  large datasets, including GNNs and Graph Transformers (GTs), with negligible overheads,
  which we analyze both theoretically and empirically. We also demonstrate that NASC
  can be integrated into GTs, boosting performance across over 10 benchmark datasets
  with various properties and tasks. NASC empowers researchers to establish a robust
  baseline performance for large datasets, eliminating the need for extensive hyperparameter
  tuning, while supporting mini-batch training and seamless integration with popular
  graph learning libraries.
